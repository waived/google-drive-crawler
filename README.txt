 >>>>  Google Drive - Shared Folder Crawler  <<<<
////---====================================---\\\\

Purpose:
    Ultimately the goal of this script is to mimic the URL API scheme
    generated by Google Drives and attempt to generate valid public
    shared-folders. Here, one can snoop on the content and potentially
    spy some sensitive/interesting information.

    Because of the security implementations by Google, this script forces
    the end-user to utilize SOCKS4 proxies. If you need a fresh/checked
    list of proxies (SOCKS4 or otherwise) you can load them from my other
    project here: https://github.com/waived/proxy-scraper

Report:
    If the request yields a 'OK 200' response the URL will be alerted to
    the user. Otherwise, any other error code (ex: Error 504) will not
    be reported and the URL will be considered non-existed/dead.

Bugs:
    None. However, please feel free to report any :)
